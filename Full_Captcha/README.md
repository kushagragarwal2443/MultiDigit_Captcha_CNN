# MultiDigit_Captcha_CNN

This repository contains code written to predict the sum of the digits appearing in an image containing hand-written digits. 

### Input to the Model:
* 30000 images with labels (sum of the digits in the image)
* Used a train-val split of 80-20 resulting in 24000 training images and 6000 validation images

#### Methodology used:
* I tried multiple architectures, including but not limited to SimpleCNNs, Yann LeCun's LeNet-5 (Modified) for MNIST datasets, and the one described below

### Loss and Optimisation

* I used the "Categorical cross entropy loss" with "ADAM" optimizer using "ACCURACY" as the metric
* The best model was trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 50

### Results

* The best model gave an accuracy of 93% on training data and a 80% accuracy on validation set
* The training loss was 0.3 and the validation loss was 0.9
* Some examples from the test dataset were plotted with correct and predicted labels and all of them were predicted correctly
* Confusion matrix was created
* Important metrics like Precision, Recall, F1 score along with their supports were calculated

### Future Work

* I plan to add another model to this dataset, which will in-principle do the hard-task of segmentation itself (using contour-detection, edge-detection or connected-component algorithms) and then use the padded, rescaled 4 numbers which have been segmented out and predict their labels. Then the sum of these labels would be the correct label. The model can be trained on MNIST dataset using SOTA architectures.
* This method would yield superior results as it does the hard task of segmentation itself, can have more data (MNIST alone is million images), can also use benchmark models for the MNIST data.
